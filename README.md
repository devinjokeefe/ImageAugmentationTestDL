# Image Augmentation Test - Deep Learning

This was a study which I did to examine the effects of various Image Augmentation effects on image classification accuracy on the training and test sets. I used the Cifar-10 dataset as a basis for my experiments. The scripts use Python, along with the Keras, PyPlot, Numpy, PIL, and SciPy libraries.
